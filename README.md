blueprint to implement a simple spike with [writer-framework](https://github.com/writer/writer-framework)

* prototype quick application with low code UI
* build demo for writer-framework
* ...

## Getting started

### Run in gitpod

[gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) can be used as an IDE. You can load the code inside to try the code.

### Run in local

1. clone this repository

2. remove .git directory

* [prepare the blueprint to start a new project](./prepare%20the%20blueprint.md)

```bash
alfred edit
```

## The latest version

You can find the latest version to ...

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FabienArcellier/blueprint-writer-framework.git
```

## Developper guideline

### Add a dependency

``bash
poetry add requests
``
### Install development environment

Use make to instanciate a python virtual environment in ./venv and install the
python dependencies.

```bash
poetry install
```

### Update release dependencies

Use make to instanciate a python virtual environment in ./venv and freeze
dependencies version

```bash
poetry update update
```

### Activate the python environment

When you setup the requirements, a `venv` directory on python 3 is created.
To activate the venv, you have to execute :

```bash
poetry shell
```

### Run the continuous integration process

Before commit or send a pull request, you have to execute `pylint` to check the syntax
of your code and run the unit tests to validate the behavior.

```bash
$ poetry run alfred ci
```

### Rebuild the blueprint from scratch

I have to regularly rebuild it to update dependencies.

* [maintain this blueprint](./maintain%20this%20blueprint.md)
